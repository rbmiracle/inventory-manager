~ Group D's Inventory Management System ~

~~~~~ Project Description ~~~~~

This program is designed to allow a user to perform CRUD operations on an inventory file.
It uses a CSV-format file to store persistent data and features a fully-functioning GUI
for handling user interactions. Instructions for using the GUI are included below.

The program utilizes the ArrayBag data structure to represent the inventory data within
the program. The CSV is updated from that internal inventory (ArrayBag) object as needed.
